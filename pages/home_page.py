            **What is AI?**  
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is like having a super smart computer friend that can help create stories, jokes, and learn new things!
            
            **How does it work?**  
            You give AI your ideas (like picking a hero), and it uses its "brain" to create something amazing just for you!
            
            **You're the creative director!**  
            AI helps bring your ideas to life, but YOU are the one choosing what to create!
